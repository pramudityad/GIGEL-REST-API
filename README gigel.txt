1. run app gigel.py
2. Now REST API up and running, so it is time to test it using API testing tool (i used insomnia)
3. in side bar add request (post/put/get). each request has it function
	post = for create new profile
	put = edit/update profile
	get = query profile info
4. in address bar in insomnia type, for example 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/dul@gmail.com' then select post for create new profile. then click send, the result will be error because the email address dul@gmail.com has already used
5.etc

disclaimer : this app create by my self and i am aware this not perfect enough but it works
